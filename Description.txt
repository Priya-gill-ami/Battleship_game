This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming and divided into seven Python files. 
Each file handles one clear responsibility, which keeps the whole project organized and easier to debug. 
The goal was to design a Battleship game that allows two players to place ships, guess coordinates, and play until one player sinks all ships.

Project Structure (7 Modules)
1. ship.py

This file has the Ship class.
It stores the ship name, size, its coordinates, and how many hits it has taken.
It also has two important functions:

register_hit() to record when the ship is hit

is_sunk() to check if the ship is fully destroyed

The ship manages its own data (encapsulation).
----------------------------------------------------------------

2. coordinate.py

This file helps convert inputs like "A5" into numerical row/column values.
It checks if the coordinate is valid, inside the board, and properly formatted.
Having a separate file keeps the coordinate logic clean.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

3. board.py

The Board class stores the full grid, all ships, and hit/miss information.
It checks if a ship can be placed, makes sure they don’t overlap, and processes attacks.
It also prints boards in two modes:

player’s real board

guess board (only shows hits/misses)

All game calculations mainly happen here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

4. player.py

This file holds the Player class.
Each player has a:
name
board
list of ships
guess counter

The player is responsible for placing ships and handling guesses. 
It also checks if the player has lost the game.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5. fileStore.py

This module works like a memory for the game.
It stores:
winner name
number of turns
best score
This allows the game to show the high score each time it starts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. game.py

This is the game controller.
It switches turns, validates guesses, prints boards, checks win conditions, and talks to fileStore.py to save results.
It separates main game logic from player logic, which keeps the project cleaner.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. main.py

This is the file the user runs.
It shows the welcome message, loads the high score, gets player names, starts ship placement, and begins the game loop.
After someone wins, it shows final boards and asks if players want another match.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Flow of the Program

Game starts → high score is displayed
Players enter names
Each player places ships one by one
Game loop begins
Players guess coordinates, hit or miss
Continue until all ships of one player are sunk
Winner is announced → result saved to file
Ask to play again

OOP concepu

Encapsulation: Each class manages its own data (Ship knows hits, Board knows grid, etc.)

Polymorphism: Common function names like print_board() used in different ways
