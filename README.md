# Battleship_game
This project is a console-based Battleship game built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming. Two players place ships, take turns guessing coordinates, and track hits, misses, and sunk ships. The game follows strict rules and stores results using file handling.

🔹 Key Features

Object-Oriented design using classes and modules

Separate files for game logic, players, ships, board, coordinates, and file handling

User-driven ship placement using middle-coordinate placement

Input validation for coordinates, ship placement, and turns

Turn-based gameplay with hit, miss, and ship-sunk detection

Persistent file storage for game results and high scores

Clear console output for guess boards and game status

🔹 Technologies Used

Python 3

Console-based I/O

File handling for persistent data
